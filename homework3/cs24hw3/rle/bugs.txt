1. I changed the beginning of the find space loop so that
the byte storing the number of occurrences would be moved 
into al, then eax would be added to the running total



2. I changed the amount that esi is incremented in the find
space loop from 1 to 2, since the address of each
(count, value) pair is 2 bytes after the previous one.



3. I moved the data buffer back into %ecx after the malloc
call, since in cdecl %ecx is a caller save register



4. I added a line to increment edi each time in the write loop
so that the character would be written to the correct address
(rather than the same address over and over).
